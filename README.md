# Side Projects

### These are side projects that I work on during my spare time to acquire new skills

##### Palmer Penguins is a neural network classification model to identify different species of penguins based on their bill and flipper length
##### Housing Regression is a multiple linear regression to predict housing prices based on house age and distance to the nearest subway station
